# Charger Detector

## üìï„ÉªDescription

This project provides a solution to detect when a charger is connected to a computer, even when the computer is in sleep mode. Upon detection, a sound is played to notify the user. The service is configured to run in the background using systemd, with the capability to handle events even during sleep.

## üì¶„ÉªPrerequisites

- Linux with systemd configured.
- Terminal access with administrator privileges.
- A functional audio device.

## ‚å®Ô∏è„Éª„ÉªSteps to Install and Configure the Service

1. Clone the Repository and Compile the Program

Clone the project repository and compile the program using make:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UgolinOlle/charger-detector.git
cd charger-detector
make install
```

2. Configure the systemd Service

The service is configured to run under systemd as a user service. Once installed, it can be enabled and started with the following commands:

```bash
systemctl --user enable charger-detector.service
systemctl --user start charger-detector.service
```

3. Check the Service Status

You can verify if the service is running correctly with:

```bash
systemctl --user status charger-detector.service
```

4. Test the Program

Plug in the charger to verify that the program plays a sound upon detection. If the sound is not played, ensure that your audio system is functional and that the service is active.
